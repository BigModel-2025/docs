We regularly assess our security practices to incorporate new technologies and methods. However, please note that no Internet or email transmission is completely secure or error-free. Specifically, emails sent to or from us may not be fully secure. As a result, we advise you to exercise caution when deciding what information to send to us via the Services or email. Additionally, we are not responsible for any bypassing of privacy settings or security measures on the Service or third-party websites.

## 7. How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data

We retain personal data for as long as it is needed to provide our Services and for the other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we retain personal data when required to fulfill contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest (such as improving and developing our Services and enhancing their safety, security, and stability), and for the exercise or defense of legal claims.

Retention periods vary based on the volume, type, and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which we use it, and any legal requirements, among other factors. For instance, when we process your personal data to provide you with the Services, we retain it as long as you have an account. This includes your account information, input. If you violate any of our terms, policies, or guidelines, we may immediately remove your account information, input from public view, but we will keep the personal data as needed to address the violation.

When the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.

## 8. Where We Store Your Personal Data

Depending on your location and the features of our Services that you access or use, your personal data may be transferred and processed outside the jurisdiction in which you reside, including to an affiliated company within the Z.AI Group or a third party (as outlined in section 4) located overseas.

We generally provide the Services from Singapore, and our group companies and their designated service providers are typically located in Singapore. As a result, your personal data is generally processed in Singapore.

We implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data remains protected in line with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, and we only transfer your data abroad in compliance with applicable laws and legally recognized transfer mechanisms.
