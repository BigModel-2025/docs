## Key Advantages

**Outstanding Motion Dynamics:**  Generated videos feature smooth, large-scale movements, breaking free from the sluggishness typical of AI-generated content. Perfectly suited for imaginative scenes and special effects, every frame bursts with energy.

**Precise Semantic Understanding:**  Powered by strong semantic comprehension, the model strictly follows input prompts. Especially in image-to-video tasks, it efficiently generates diverse visuals, delivering a smoother "prompt-to-pull" experience.

**Exceptional Anime Style Generation:**  Delivers outstanding performance in anime-style video generation—producing high-quality outputs with remarkable style consistency, even when using anime images as input, effectively avoiding sudden style shifts.

**Breakthrough in Subject Consistency:**  Overcomes consistency limitations common in image-based workflows. Ensures high subject consistency without requiring a manually prepared first frame, greatly simplifying the creative process and boosting efficiency.

## Usage Instructions

1. **French Kiss Template:**

- Image Quantity: Required; Only 1 image can be uploaded.

![French Kiss Template](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/static/platform/agent/french-kiss-template.png)

- Number of People in Image: Only supports two-person collages or group photos.
- Guidelines: Subjects should be shown from the front and upper body only, with no props in hand for best results.
- Prompt: The two figures in the image gradually move closer, then passionately kiss with alternating deep and firm intensity.
- Effect Limitations: If a full-body image is uploaded, the result may show no kiss, a weaker kiss, or a shorter duration—failing to convey the intended passionate effect.

2. **Turn-and-Dance Template:**

- Image Quantity: Required; Only 1 image can be uploaded.

![Turn-and-Dance Template](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/static/platform/agent/dance-template.png)

- Number of People in Image: Supports single-person photos in either realistic or anime style.
- Guidelines: Best results are achieved when the character is alone and the image shows at least above-thigh framing.
- Prompt: "Video content: The character performs a rhythmic dance sequence in an indoor setting. She starts by swaying her hips, then turns to the other side, briefly shaking her hips in a playful manner. Her movements are smooth and confident, consistently emphasizing rhythm and expressiveness. Requirement: Movement intensity – high."
- Effect Limitations: During the turning motion, body structure distortion or hand clipping may occasionally occur. For hip-shaking actions, motion may sometimes appear disconnected or visually unnatural.

3. **Bikini / Muscle Transformation Template:**

- Image Quantity: Required; Only 1 image can be uploaded.

![Bikini / Muscle Transformation Template](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/static/platform/agent/transformation-template.png)

- Number of People in Image: Only supports single-person photos (female or male) in either realistic or anime style.
- Guidelines: Best results are achieved with half-body or full-body images. If the subject in the input image is female, the output will feature a bikini transformation video showcasing the body. If the subject is male, the output will show a shirtless transformation video highlighting muscular physique.
- Prompt: "Video content: The transformation varies depending on the subject's gender. If the image shows a female: 'The woman's clothing transforms seamlessly—her outfit smoothly changes into a stylish bikini. At the final moment, she confidently places her hands on her waist, exuding grace and poise.' If the image shows a male: 'The man swiftly removes his shirt, revealing a muscular physique matching his skin tone. He then steps forward.' Requirements: 1. If the image is a close-up or medium shot, set the camera motion to "zoom out." 2. Movement intensity: high."
- Effect Limitations: If the subject's gender features are unclear, incorrect gender identification may occur, resulting in mixed or incorrect bikini/muscle transformations. In bikini transformations, clothing may not be fully removed. If a two-person image is uploaded, one subject may be missing in the output.
