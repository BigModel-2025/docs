Z.AI's GLM-4.5 models can be integrated with Claude Code through an Anthropic API-compatible endpoint. This allows Claude Code to communicate with GLM-4.5 without requiring any code modifications to Claude Code itself.

## 1. Obtain Your Z.AI API Key

Visit Z.AI to get your [API Key](https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list)

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

After installing Claude Code, set up environment variables using one of the following two methods:

**Method 1: Using a Script (Recommended for First-Time Users)**

```bash
curl -O "http://bigmodel-us3-prod-marketplace.cn-wlcb.ufileos.com/1753683755292-30b3431f487b4cc1863e57a81d78e289.sh?ufileattname=claude_code_prod_zai.sh"
```

**Method 2: Manual Configuration**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic

export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN={YOUR_API_KEY} 
```

## 3. Quick Start with Claude Code

> If prompted with "Do you want to use this API key," select "Yes."

After launching, grant Claude Code permission to access files in your folder as shown below:
