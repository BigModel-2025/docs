Z.AI's GLM-4.5 models can be integrated with Claude Code through an Anthropic API-compatible endpoint. This allows Claude Code to communicate with GLM-4.5 without requiring any code modifications to Claude Code itself.

## 1. Obtain Your Z.AI API Key

Visit Z.AI to get your [API Key](https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list)

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

After installing Claude Code, set up environment variables using one of the following two methods:

**Method 1: Using a Script (Recommended for First-Time Users)**

```bash
curl -O "http://bigmodel-us3-prod-marketplace.cn-wlcb.ufileos.com/1753683755292-30b3431f487b4cc1863e57a81d78e289.sh?ufileattname=claude_code_prod_zai.sh"
```

**Method 2: Manual Configuration**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic

export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN={YOUR_API_KEY} 
```

## 3. Quick Start with Claude Code

> If prompted with "Do you want to use this API key," select "Yes."

After launching, grant Claude Code permission to access files in your folder as shown below:

You can now use Claude Code for development\!

Mark: The default model is **GLM-4.5**. We support switching to **GLM-4.5-Air** by modifying the Claude Code configuration file like below. 

## Additional Instructions: How to Switch the Model in Use

> Currently, switching to other models is not supported.

1. Configure `~/.claude/settings.json` with the following content:

```text
{
  "env": {
      "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "glm-4.5-air"
  }
}
```

2. Open a new terminal window and run `claude` to start Claude Code.
3. In Claude Code, enter `/status` to check the current model status.

4. To switch back to the **GLM-4.5** model, modify `~/.claude/settings.json` as follows:

```text
{
  "env": {
      "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "glm-4.5"
  }
}
```
