OpenCode is a powerful AI coding agent that can be configured to use Z.AI's GLM models.

![Description](https://opencode.ai/_astro/screenshot.Bs5D4atL_1ScNEl.webp)

## Installing OpenCode

The easiest way to install OpenCode is through the install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

You can also install it with npm:

```bash
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

## Getting Started

1. Head over to the [Z.AI API Console](https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list) to get your API key.

2. Run `opencode auth login` and select **Zhipu AI**.

   ```bash
   $ opencode auth login

   ┌  Add credential
   │
   ◆  Select provider
   │  ● Zhipu AI
   │  ...
   └
   ```

3. Enter your Zhipu AI API key.

   ```bash
   $ opencode auth login

   ┌  Add credential
   │
   ◇  Select provider
   │  Zhipu AI
   │
   ◇  Enter your API key
   │  _
   └
   ```

4. Run `opencode` to launch OpenCode.

   ```bash
   $ opencode
   ```

   Use the `/models` command to select a model like _GLM-4.5_.

   ```
   /models
   ```

## Share

OpenCode’s share feature allows you to create public links to your OpenCode conversations, so you can collaborate with teammates or get help from others.

#### How it works

When you share a conversation, OpenCode:

1. Creates a unique public URL for your session
2. Syncs your conversation history to our servers
3. Makes the conversation accessible via the shareable link — `opencode.ai/s/<share-id>`

#### Share

By default, conversations are not shared automatically. You can manually share them using the `/share` command:

```
/share
```

#### Un-share

To stop sharing a conversation and remove it from public access:

```
/unshare
```

This will remove the share link and delete the data related to the conversation.

## IDE Extensions

OpenCode integrates with VS Code, Cursor, or any IDE that supports a terminal.

#### Installation

To install OpenCode on VS Code and popular forks like Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium:

1. Open VS Code
2. Open the integrated terminal
3. Run `opencode` - the extension installs automatically

#### Usage

- **Quick Launch**: Use `Cmd+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to open OpenCode in a split terminal view, or focus an existing terminal session if one is already running.
- **New Session**: Use `Cmd+Shift+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to start a new OpenCode terminal session, even if one is already open. You can also click the OpenCode button in the UI.
- **Context Awareness**: Automatically share your current selection or tab with OpenCode.
- **File Reference Shortcuts**: Use `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac) or `Alt+Ctrl+K` (Linux/Windows) to insert file references. For example, `@File#L37-42`.

## GitHub Workflow

OpenCode integrates with your GitHub workflow. Mention `/opencode` or `/oc` in your comment, and OpenCode will execute tasks within your GitHub Actions runner.

#### Features

- **Triage issues**: Ask OpenCode to look into an issue and explain it to you.
- **Fix and implement**: Ask OpenCode to fix an issue or implement a feature. And it will work in a new branch and submits a PR with all the changes.
- **Secure**: OpenCode runs inside your GitHub's runners.

#### Installation

Run the following command in a project that is in a GitHub repo:

```bash
opencode github install
```

This will walk you through installing the GitHub app, creating the workflow, and setting up secrets.

#### Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use OpenCode in GitHub.

- **Explain an issue**

  Add this comment in a GitHub issue.

  ```
  /opencode explain this issue
  ```

  OpenCode will read the entire thread, including all comments, and reply with a clear explanation.

- **Fix an issue**

  In a GitHub issue, say:

  ```
  /opencode fix this
  ```

  And OpenCode will create a new branch, implement the changes, and open a PR with the changes.

- **Review PRs and make changes**

  Leave the following comment on a GitHub PR.

  ```
  Delete the attachment from S3 when the note is removed /oc
  ```

  OpenCode will implement the requested change and commit it to the same PR.
