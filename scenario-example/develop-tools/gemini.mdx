Gemini CLI is a command-line interface tool that can be made compatible with Z.AI's GLM models by using a customized fork.

## 1. Obtaining the Custom Version

### 1. Cloning the Custom Repository

Since the official Gemini CLI repository only supports Google's Gemini models, we need to use a customized branch that supports OpenRouter compatibility:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heartyguy/gemini-cli  
cd gemini-cli  
```

### 2. Switching to the Compatible Branch

```bash
git checkout feature/openrouter-support  
```

## 2. Environment Configuration

### 1. Setting Environment Variables
