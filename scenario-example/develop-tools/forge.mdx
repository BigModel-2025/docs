Forge Code is a powerful command-line AI programming assistant that enables you to leverage AI models directly in your projects for code development and management.

## 1. Installing Forge Code

Refer to the [Forge Code official documentation](https://forgecode.dev/docs/installation/) and run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g forgecode@latest  
```

## 2. Initialization and Verification

### 1. Navigate to Your Project Directory

```
cd your-project-directory  
```

### 2. Launch Forge

```

## 3. Configuring the API

### 1. Create an Environment Configuration File

Create a `.env` file in your project root directory and configure the API details:

```
# OpenAI-Compatible Providers  
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_provider_api_key  
OPENAI_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4  
```

### 2. Select a Model

Once the API is configured, Forge will automatically detect it. In the Forge chat, enter `/model` to open the model selection interface:

Select your desired model to begin making calls.

## 4. Getting Started

Enter your requirements in the input box to leverage the model for:

- Code generation and optimization
- Project architecture design
- Code review and refactoring
- Issue diagnosis and resolution
- Documentation writing
